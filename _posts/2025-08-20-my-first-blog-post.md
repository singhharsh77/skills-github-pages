Hello world! 👋  

This is my very first blog post on my new site.  
I’ll be using this space to share my **projects, learnings, and experiments** in tech, automation, and cloud security.  

What you can expect here:  
- 💡 Insights from my coding journey  
- ⚙️ Cool automation and DevOps tricks  
- ☁️ Cloud security notes & best practices  
- 🛠️ Personal projects and side hustles  

I’m just getting started, but there’s lots more to come. Stay tuned! ✨
